# HerbLens

### Development of the recognition of rare plant species will be advantageous in the fields such as the pharmaceutical industry, botany, agricultural, and trade activities. It is also very challenging that there is a large diversity of plant species and it is very hard to classify them when they can be very similar to each other. This project presents the recognition of Indian medicinal plants using with their respective leaf images using transfer learning algorithms, pre-trained models and few short learning. We propose a classification model to cultivate the performance of classifying leaf images. In the next step, we demonstrated the use of image augmentation and few short learning for achieving better performance results. Finally, we compared the performance of transfer learning algorithms on our dataset such as Resnet50, Xception, MobilenetV2 . We also evaluated our recognition system using 30 species of Indian medicinal plants and each species consists of digital leaf images. The evaluation result shows that Indian Medicinal Plant Recognition is promising for medicinal plants identification.

## Motivation

### Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine practiced in India and has its roots in the Vedic times, approximately 5000 years ago. The main constituents of ayurvedic medicines are plant leaves and other parts of plants like root, bark etc. More than 8000 plants of Indian origin have been found to be of medicinal value. Combinations of a small subset amounting to 1500 of these plants are used in Herbal medicines of different systems of India. Specifically, commercial Ayurvedic preparations use 500 of these plants. Over 80% of plants used in ayurvedic formulations are collected from the forests and wastelands whereas the remaining are cultivated in agricultural lands. In the ancient past, the Ayurvedic physicians themselves picked the medicinal plants and prepared the medicines for their patients. Today only a few practitioners follow this practice. The manufacturing and marketing of Ayurvedic drugs has become a thriving industry whose turnover exceeds Rs 4000 crores. The number of licensed Ayurvedic medicine manufacturers in India easily exceeds 8500. This commercialization of Ayurvedic sector has brought in to focus several questions regarding the quality of raw materials used for Ayurvedic medicines.
